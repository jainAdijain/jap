# JAP: Job Application Pipeline

**Version 0.1.2 (Phase 0), 29 Oct 2026.**

JAP watches the public job boards of the companies you pick (Greenhouse, Lever and Ashby),
lists the jobs that match your profile, and prepares or submits applications for you to review.
The [JAP PRD](https://claude.ai/artifact/WL9RYjsPDCTmknMLRqzKRj) is the single source of truth;
the [build plan](https://claude.ai/artifact/1TrqC2jt8SuPVbULa8i6eU) and the
[engineering design doc](https://claude.ai/artifact/XsWXaEvBdEsFf97GguqtAy) follow it.

## What runs

| Service | URL (127.0.0.1 only) | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ui | http://localhost:5173 | React + Vite UI (status page in Phase 0) |
| app | http://localhost:8001 | FastAPI JSON API and Inngest functions (`/api/health`, `/api/inngest`) |
| inngest | http://localhost:8290 | Inngest dev server, runs every pipeline step |
| db | localhost:5432 | Postgres 16 with pgvector, pg_trgm, pgcrypto |
| adminer | http://localhost:8080 | Database browser (server `db`, user/password/db `jap`) |

Each host port can be changed in `.env` (`JAP_UI_PORT`, `JAP_API_PORT`, `JAP_INNGEST_PORT`,
`JAP_DB_PORT`, `JAP_ADMINER_PORT`). The API and Inngest use 8001 and 8290 so they don't clash with
other projects on 8000 and 8288-8289 (an Inngest dev server publishes both). Inside Docker the services keep their usual ports.

Ollama is **not** in Docker. It runs natively on the Mac so it can use the GPU, and the app
reaches it at `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

## First run (macOS)

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).
2. Pull the embedder: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
3. `make start` creates `.env` from `.env.example` the first time. Put your OpenRouter key and
   Gmail app password in `.env` (it is gitignored; never commit it).
4. Open http://localhost:5173: API, Database, Inngest and Ollama should all show OK.

## Make targets

| Target | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `make start` | Build and start the stack, wait for `/api/health`, check Ollama |
| `make stop` | Stop the stack (data kept) |
| `make reset` | Asks first, then wipes the database: down -v, up, migrate, seed |
| `make clean` | Asks first, then removes containers, volumes, JAP images and build caches; `data/` is kept |
| `make logs` / `make ps` | Follow logs / list services |
| `make migrate` | `alembic upgrade head` in the app container |
| `make seed` | Load `seed/companies.yaml` and `seed/skills.yaml` |
| `make test` | ruff, mypy, pytest for app; lint and build for ui |
| `make backup` / `make restore FILE=...` | Dump to / restore from `data/backups/` |
| `make ollama-check` | Is Ollama answering with `nomic-embed-text` pulled |

## Layout

frontend/           src/pages, src/components, src/api
data/               gitignored: resumes, screenshots, cover letters, backups

## Version history
