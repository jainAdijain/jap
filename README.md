# JAP: Job Application Pipeline

**Version 0.7.1 (Phase 6), 29 Oct 2026.**

JAP watches the public job boards of the companies you pick (Greenhouse, Lever and Ashby),
lists the jobs that match your profile, and prepares or submits applications for you to review.
The [JAP PRD](https://claude.ai/artifact/WL9RYjsPDCTmknMLRqzKRj) is the single source of truth;
the [build plan](https://claude.ai/artifact/1TrqC2jt8SuPVbULa8i6eU) and the
[engineering design doc](https://claude.ai/artifact/XsWXaEvBdEsFf97GguqtAy) follow it.

## What runs

| Service | URL (127.0.0.1 only) | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ui | http://localhost:5173 | React + Vite UI: My profile, and a Dashboard with jobs, possible duplicates and the status checks |
| app | http://localhost:8001 | FastAPI JSON API and Inngest functions (`/api/health`, `/api/inngest`) |
| inngest | http://localhost:8290 | Inngest dev server, runs every pipeline step |
| db | localhost:5432 | Postgres 16 with pgvector, pg_trgm, pgcrypto |
| adminer | http://localhost:8080 | Database browser (server `db`, user/password/db `jap`) |

Each host port can be changed in `.env` (`JAP_UI_PORT`, `JAP_API_PORT`, `JAP_INNGEST_PORT`,
`JAP_DB_PORT`, `JAP_ADMINER_PORT`). The API and Inngest use 8001 and 8290 so they don't clash with
other projects on 8000 and 8288-8289 (an Inngest dev server publishes both). Inside Docker the services keep their usual ports.

Ollama is **not** in Docker. It runs natively on the Mac so it can use the GPU, and the app
reaches it at `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

## First run (macOS)

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).
2. Pull the embedder: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
3. `make start` creates `.env` from `.env.example` the first time. Put your OpenRouter key and
   Gmail app password in `.env` (it is gitignored; never commit it).
4. Open http://localhost:5173: API, Database, Inngest and Ollama should all show OK.

## Personal data and models

No name, email, phone, address or profile link is sent to any model. `backend/llm/redact.py`
swaps them for placeholders such as `[NAME]`, a guard blocks any request that still contains
one, and `backend/llm/client.py` is the only code that talks to OpenRouter (a test enforces
it). Each call is logged in `llm_call` with its cost; model steps stop once this month's
spend reaches `JAP_MONTHLY_COST_CAP_USD`.

## Fetching jobs

Add companies in My profile by pasting their Greenhouse, Lever or Ashby board URL (or typing
the name), then press **Run: find only** on the Dashboard. Each board is one `fetch-board` run
in Inngest, throttled to one request a second per ATS. Job descriptions are read by the
extract model once per description: a re-run with unchanged postings costs nothing. The
first run on a big board (some list 700+ jobs) makes one model call per job, so start with a
few companies and watch the AI spend in My profile.

## One row per job

The same job is often posted on more than one board. After each run JAP groups postings into
listings: one row per company and role, with a badge for each board. Company names are
cleaned (Inc, Ltd, Technologies and the like are dropped, and aliases in `company_alias` map
to one name) and titles are reduced to a canonical role (Sr becomes Senior, locations and
work-mode words are dropped). Seniority always stays in the role, so Senior and Junior are
two rows. Postings join a listing when they share a requisition ID, have the same canonical
role, or are a near match (titles 90% alike and descriptions 92% alike). Pairs just below
that bar show under **Possible duplicates** on the Dashboard for you to Merge or Keep apart.
Merge and Split in the job panel are remembered on later runs.

## Which jobs are listed

The Dashboard lists only the jobs that match My profile. The match rule is one or more rows
of Role, Skills and Location: a job is listed when it meets every condition in at least one
row (the default lists a job that meets any one). Role means the job's cleaned title contains
one of your target roles (engineer and developer count alike); Skills means every must-have
skill is in the job; Location means a job location names one of yours, or the job is remote
and allows one of your Remote regions, or it is Remote - Worldwide. On top of that, the work
mode must be one you ticked (a job that doesn't say is listed and tagged Work mode unclear),
and excluded companies and title words are dropped.

The filter is one SQL query over the stored listings (`backend/pipeline/matching.py`), so
saving My profile updates the list in well under a second without fetching anything, and My
profile shows how many listings your unsaved changes would match. Each row shows which
conditions it matched. Totals and Jobs by role count each listing once (under the first
target role it matches, or Other); the filter bar narrows the list by role, location, status
and matched condition without changing your profile. Every run ends with the same filter.

`make demo` loads "JAP Demo Co" with six made-up postings on a Greenhouse and a Lever board,
so you can see grouping, a possible duplicate, Merge and Split without waiting for real
boards. It also loads "Globex Demo" on an Ashby board with jobs for checking the filters:
Remote - Worldwide, Remote - US, Remote - APAC, an Intern title, an unclear work mode and a
job in Berlin. Runs skip demo boards; `make demo-clear` removes them.

## What starts a run

Four things start a run, and only one run is active at a time. A trigger that fires during a
run queues one run behind it; more triggers join that queued run instead of adding another
(a role-scoped ask widens the queued run's scope).

- **Run dialog** (Run… on the Dashboard): every job on the companies you watch, or only some
  of your target roles (only those roles' jobs are stored, updated or closed), and Find only
  or Find and apply (see Applying).
- **Daily run**: the switch on the Runs card, at 06:00 in `JAP_TZ` unless you change the time
  next to it. An Inngest cron ticks every minute and fires once per day in the first five
  minutes after that time, so a run missed while the Mac sleeps is skipped, not caught up.
- **Profile save**: the stored listings are re-filtered at once, then a fetch follows in the
  background; new matching jobs appear on the Dashboard without a reload.
- **Resume update**: accepting the skills from a new resume re-filters and starts a run.

The Runs card shows the last run line (when, what triggered it, and its counts), plus the run
going now and the one queued behind it.

## Applying (Review mode)

Open a job and press **Apply now**, or pick **Find and apply** in the Run dialog to prepare
every Not applied job (up to your daily cap, 20 by default). JAP freezes the job description,
opens the posting's public form in a headless Chromium (Playwright), lists every field and
whether it is required, and fills it:

- Contact fields (name, first and last name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, website,
  location) come from My profile, by code. No model ever sees or fills them.
- The resume field gets your active resume, under its original file name.
- Other questions are looked up in the answer bank (exact question, or 80% alike).
- A required free-text question with no saved answer gets an answer drafted for this job
  from the JD and your resume (the `answer` prompt, redacted like every model call). Drafts
  are not saved to the answer bank unless you save them.
- A question only you can answer (notice period, salary, start date, work authorisation,
  relocation and the like), a required choice with no saved answer, a file JAP doesn't have,
  or a CAPTCHA stops the job at **Needs input**. Answer in the panel; the answers go to the
  answer bank (untick the box to skip that) and JAP prepares the form again.

In Review mode (the only mode until Phase 8) the job then waits at **Ready for review**:
every answer is shown, with where it came from, and editable. Nothing is sent until you
press **Approve and submit**. JAP then opens the form fresh, fills it, presses Submit once,
and keeps a screenshot of the confirmation and a Playwright trace in `data/`. The job
becomes **Applied**, and its panel shows what was sent: the date, the resume version, every
answer, the screenshot and the frozen JD. One email, "Applied: Role at Company", goes to the
address on My profile through Gmail SMTP (`GMAIL_ADDRESS` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in
`.env`), with a link to the posting and to the job in JAP.

Submissions are at least 30 seconds apart and stop at the daily cap until midnight in
`JAP_TZ`. Submit is never pressed twice: if a retry finds it was pressed without a
confirmation, the job becomes **Failed** with "Submit outcome unknown" so you check by hand.
An Applied job has no Apply now, and a run never prepares it again, even when the employer
reposts it (a repost joins the same listing). **Skip** cancels a prepared or waiting job;
**Undo** brings it back. A **Failed** job shows the reason and screenshot, with **Retry**.

## Make targets

| `make start` | Build and start the stack, wait for `/api/health`, apply migrations, check Ollama |
| `make stop` | Stop the stack (data kept) |
| `make reset` | Asks first, then wipes the database: down -v, up, migrate, seed |
| `make clean` | Asks first, then removes containers, volumes, JAP images and build caches; `data/` is kept |
| `make logs` / `make ps` | Follow logs / list services |
| `make migrate` | `alembic upgrade head` in the app container |
| `make seed` | Load `seed/companies.yaml` and `seed/skills.yaml` |
| `make test` | ruff, mypy, pytest for app; lint and build for ui |
| `make backup` / `make restore FILE=...` | Dump to / restore from `data/backups/` |
| `make llm-check` | One tiny test call to each OpenRouter model (no personal data) |
| `make ollama-check` | Is Ollama answering with `nomic-embed-text` pulled |
| `make demo` / `make demo-clear` | Load or remove the demo postings used to check dedup and the filters |
